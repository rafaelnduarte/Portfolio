## Data Scientist | Marketing Anlytics at Sigmoidal.ai

Data Scientist with expertise in marketing analytics, specializing in data analysis, statistical modeling, and digital marketing platforms. Proficient in Python, R, SQL, and Tableau with experience in customer segmentation, A/B testing, attribution modeling, email marketing optimization, and customer journey analysis. Skilled in manipulating and analyzing large datasets, with a strong focus on data-driven decision-making. 

Excellent communicator and collaborator, able to work with cross-functional teams to present findings and make recommendations to improve marketing performance.Over the past 3 years, I have impacted the business, helping generate millions of dollars in revenue for the company. 

All in all, I believe my greatest asset is not being extremely technical. I'm a businessman first and a programmer second, which means I understand the big picture and can see beyond the codes and algorithms, which helps translate technical work into real-life results.
